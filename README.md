<hr />

I have several years of experience ranging from working at small-scale startups in the medical and AI industry to a bigger scale-up in the media and entertainment industry. 

I care deeply about UX and DX alike and always strive for the code to be just as delightful for developers as the user interfaces built with it should be for the end users.

I value good product management, because if I can see that the product I am working on is solving the right problems in the right way, it really fuels my dedication.

Finally I am very keen on productivity topics and techniques for focused work and effective communication. Especially working remotely I think it is extremely important to pay attention to how information is shared and time is allocated.
